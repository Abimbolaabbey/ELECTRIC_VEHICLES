# Electric Vehicle Analysis

![](woman.png)

This project is an analysis of electric vehicles to identify trends and patterns in their characteristics, such as range and recharge time. 

The dataset used in this analysis contains information on vehicle make, model, class, motor power, transmission type, fuel type, range, recharge time, and consumption.


### Research Questions

#### The analys is aimed to answer the following research questions:

* What is the average range of electric vehicles by vehicle class?

* What is the average recharge time of electric vehicles?

* Which vehicle has the best range and recharge time combination?

* What is the correlation between recharge time and range for electric vehicles?

* What is the correlation between battery capacity and range for electric vehicles?

### Conclusion

The analysis shows that there are significant differences in range and recharge time among electric vehicles, and that these differences are related to vehicle class, battery capacity, and transmission type. These findings can help consumers make informed decisions when purchasing electric vehicles, and can also inform manufacturers in their design and production processes.

#### Tools and Technologies

The analysis was performed using R programming language,SQL and Excel for data cleaning.

The dataset was obtained from [Canada open data repository](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64#wb-auto-6)

#### Future Work

Future work could involve expanding the dataset to include more variables such as price, acceleration, and safety ratings, which could provide a more comprehensive analysis of electric vehicles. Additionally, further analysis could be done on specific vehicle models and their performance in relation to range and recharge time.
